From there following the computations are straightforward.

The first part is messy because it is faster to count all bytes at the same time. For the second part, partitioning seems the most straightforward approach, but I have a lot of code duplication."],["day04","Day 4: I encoded the board into row and column indices for each possible ball. I took a huge performance penalty for using `method(self)` instead of `method(&self)` at first."],["day05","Day 5: This solution process highlighted two things. First, branching logic can be expensive. My original solution to part 1 was 3x slower than the solution to part 2, but the only difference was checking if `dx` or `dy` was zero. Second, this difference reduced greatly when I switched to a narrower data type, using `i/u16` instead of `i/u32` and using a `u8` for my `grid`s representing the vents."],["day06","Day 6: This was a reasonably straightforward problem.
